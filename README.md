# Jquery Server Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 2 Day Sprint_

This is my first calculator app! It does basic math and records a history of the equations you have entered and their answers in an array stored in a local server. The user interface is similar to that of a physical calculator in that I you have to press (or in this case click) each button to get a result in the input field. The buttons I have included are as follows.

- A 'C' button that clears the current input field
- A 'CH' that clears the equation history in the server and on the DOM
- A '&larr;' that functions like a backspace button
- Five operator buttons / * - +
- Ten buttons for numbers 0-9
- A . so decimals can be entered
- A % which divides the current number in the input by 100
- Last there's the equals button, which runs the equation and replaces it in the input field with the answer.
