# Jquery Server Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 2 Days_

This is my first calculator app! It does basic math and records a history of the equations you have entered and their answers in an array stored in a local server. The user interface is similar to that of a physical calculator in that I you have to press (or in this case click) each button to get a result in the input field. The buttons I have included are as follows.

- A 'C' button that clears the current input field
- A 'CH' that clears the equation history in the server and on the DOM
- A '&larr;' that functions like a backspace button
- Five operator buttons / * - +
- Ten buttons for numbers 0-9
- A . so decimals can be entered
- A % which divides the current number in the input by 100
- Last there's the equals button, which runs the equation and replaces it in the input field with the answer.

1. Clone the app and open it up in the editor of your choice and run an `npm install`

## Usage
